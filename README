3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged <kernel_version>/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_branch>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyAMA0(UART1) at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x90000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0xa0000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
loadaddr=0xa0000000
fdtaddr=0x90000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=ni0
ethact=DPMAC17@rgmii-id
ethprime=DPMAC17@rgmii-id
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-lx2160a-rdb.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyAMA0
baudrate=115200
othbootargs=earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0x21c0000

Note: If the u-boot does not start the MC and deploy data path layout, please
use the command 'fsl_mc start mc 0x80a00000 0x80e00000' to start the MC and
command 'fsl_mc lazyapply dpl 0x80d00000' to deploy data path layout, the last
command can avoid the error log 'ERROR: fsl-mc: DPL is not applied' for booting
the linux kernel image.

5. Update NXP's pre-built image
===============================

5.1. On-Board NOR Flash vbank Configuration
-------------------------------------------

Depending on on-board switch configuration for FLEXSPI flash; software
boots from DEV#0 and DEV#1. The default on-board switch configuration
boots the board from DEV#0. The board can boot from DEV#1 by using
the qixis_reset altbank command from the DEV#0 u-boot prompt.

The RDB comes pre-loaded with all binaries in DEV#0.
Users are able to program images in 2 separate virtual flash banks (DEV#0
and DEV#1). Images in DEV#0 are locked to prevent accidental erasure or
corruption. Initially, the same images are also programmed in DEV#1. This
bank is not locked so users have the option to download and program new
images into DEV#1 as needed. The instructions below list commands to
download images to DEV#1 and to boot from DEV#1.


5.2. NXP's pre-built image
--------------------------

NXP provides a pre-built image which contains U-Boot, RCW, etc.
Please download it through:

 wget https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/sdk/lsdk2004/firmware_lx2160ardb_rev2_uboot_xspiboot.img
and burn it to the target board under the U-Boot prompt using the commands below:

 => sf probe 0:1;
 => tftp 0xa0000000 firmware_lx2160ardb_rev2_uboot_xspiboot.img
 => sf erase 0 +$filesize;sf write 0xa0000000 0 $filesize

 => qixis_reset altbank
to switch to DEV#1

Note: if you want to program the DEV#0 , please firstly change to DEV#1,
then use the above steps to program the pre-built image to #DEV0. After
burn of the image, use the following command to boot from #DEV0.
 => reset
Please be very careful when load those binaries to flash.

5.3. FlexSPI NOR Flash Chip-select
--------------------------
On the LX2160ARDB revisions 1.0, switch SW1 bits 6-8 to control which bank
the SoC loads from when it powers up. The relevant values are:

Switch Settings 	NOR CS
off off off 		Load from NOR Flash Dev#0
off off on 		Load from NOR Flash Dev#1

5.4. NXP's SDK user manual
--------------------------

To get more details about above descriptions, please refer to instructions
mentioned in the sections

	"4.2 LSDK memory layout and Userland"
and
	"4.1.13 LSDK Quick Start Guide for LX2160ARDB"

in the NXP's SDK user manual

	"Layerscape Software Development Kit User Guide 20.04.pdf".


6. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.4/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-lx2xxx/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-lx2xxx.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

Since this BSP doesn't have a firmware to read the uboot from a partition table,
WIC image only contains kernel, dtb and rootfs. We still need to write U-boot
image to NOR flash directly as "bootloader/README" described.

6.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user only need to execute the below command:

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-lx2xxx.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

6.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile fsl-lx2160a-rdb.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0xa0000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x90000000;

=> setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0,115200 earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0x21c0000 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw no_console_suspend ip=dhcp

=> setenv bootcmd 'fsl_mc start mc 0x80a00000 0x80e00000; fsl_mc lazyapply dpl 0x80d00000; fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr'

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;


7. Enable on-board 10G ports in kernel
======================================

LX2160A-RDB Rev2.0 reference board contains 2 on-board 1G ports, 2 on-board 10G ports, and 1 on-board 40G ports.

They can be found in u-boot as below:
DPMAC17@xgmii and DPMAC18@xgmii are 1G Copper ports,
DPMAC3@xgmii and DPMAC4@xgmii are 10G Copper ports.
DPMAC2@xlaui4 is 40G Optical ports.

These ports' status are controlled by DPL. SDK provides a default DPL:

dpl-2dpni.dtb

It enables the DPMAC17@xgmii port and DPMAC2@xlaui4 port.
To enable other ports in kernel, user can modify this DPL or through an
userspace application "restool" which is provided by SDK.
Unfortunately, the DPL has NXP's private license,
WindRiver Linux can't merge them.
So if user want to enable other ports in WindRiver Linux, user can
update SDK's DPL's "connections" section manually:

	connections {
		connection@0{
			endpoint1 = "dpni@0";
			endpoint2 = "dpmac@17";
		};
	};


For instance, if user want to enalbe the first Optical port, can replace

			endpoint2 = "dpmac@17";
to

			endpoint2 = "dpmac@18";

Then generate a new DPL on Host:

dtc -I dts -O dtb dpl-eth.0x13.dts -o dpl.dtb

Upload this DPL to board and deploy it onto the board:

tftp d0000000 <path>/dpl-eth.0x13.dtb; sf erase d00000 +c0000;sf write d0000000 d00000 c0000;

To get more details about above descriptions, please refer to instructions
mentioned in the NXP's SDK user manual

	"4.1.13.6 Bringing up DPPA2 network interfaces"
in
	"Layerscape Software Development Kit User Guide 20.04.pdf".

8. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

boot kernel - the first kernel that you start and supports kexec,
              from U-Boot for instance.
capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash.

To build the boot or capture kernel, use the following option with the configure
command for your project:

	--template=feature/kexec,feature/kdump

To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, pass "crashkernel=512M"
via the U-Boot command line.

NOTES:
1. Use vmlinux as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the directory
   tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/vmlinux
2. 512 MB (the size of the memory reserved for crash kernel) is the
   recommended amount of memory. If you add more features to the kernel, you
   can increase this value to accommodate the capture kernel.

Workaround:
1. Kexec: DPAA2 is unsupported in 2nd kernel.
   User can use on-board Intel E1000e card to do Ethernet functions in 2nd
   kernel(e.g., mount NFS, scp).
   User can turn DPAA2 off in two ways:
a) Don't call "fsl_mc start" in U-Boot command line, this will disable the
   DPAA2 both in the 1st and 2nd kernel.
b) If 1st kernel has already enabled DPAA2, please use the below 3 commands
   to destroy all DPNI interfaces in 1st kernel before calling "kexec -e":

   # restool dprc show dprc.1 | grep dpni
   /* Above command is to find all DPNI interfaces. */

   # echo dpni.0 > /sys/bus/fsl-mc/devices/dpni.0/driver/unbind
   /* Unbind DPNI interface from fsl_mc driver */

   # restool dpni destroy dpni.0
   /* Destroy this DPNI interface */
c) User needs to append argument "irqchip.gicv3_nolpi=1" to the first kernel
   to disable LPI to make Kexec work.

2. Kdump: PCI-MSI and SMP is unsupported in 2nd kernel.
   User needs to append two arguments "pci=nomsi maxcpus=1".
   Since this 2nd kernel operates under significantly constrained
   initialization conditions and is not meant to be a "replacement" kernel.
   Rather it has a single goal -- to enable data collection with respect to
   the issue that impacted the initial kernel, and nothing else.

For more detailed information about kdump, please refer to
Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt in the kernel source tree.

9. DPDK
=======

By default, the DPDK user space package is not installed. In order to install
DPDK package to rootfs, please refer to wrlinux/templates/feature/dpdk/README.
